# Songsterr Popup Blocker

**Songsterr Popup Blocker** is a Tampermonkey script designed to enhance your experience on Songsterr by removing intrusive popups and blur effects, ensuring smooth, uninterrupted playback and visible controls.

## üöÄ Features

- **Popup Removal**: Automatically removes the annoying "Upgrade to Plus" popup that interrupts your practice sessions.
- **Blur Removal**: Clears out unwanted blur overlays that affect the visibility of controls and footer.
- **Dynamic Blur Detection**: Monitors and removes any new blur-like elements dynamically as the page loads or updates.
- **Modular and Scalable**: Easily extendable, with the ability to modify or add more elements to remove.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Tampermonkey** (or another userscript manager) installed on your browser.

### Steps to Install:

1. **Install Tampermonkey**:
   - Download and install the [Tampermonkey extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
   
2. **Add the Userscript**:
   - Download or clone the [Songsterr Popup Blocker](https://github.com/yourusername/Songsterr-Popup-Blocker) repository.
   - Open **Tampermonkey**, click the **"Add a new script"** button, and paste the contents of the `AnnoyingFuckingPopupBlocker.js` script into the editor.
   - Save the script, and you're ready to go!

3. **Enjoy Uninterrupted Play**:
   - Visit [Songsterr](https://www.songsterr.com/) and experience a smoother, cleaner interface free of popups and blur effects!

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The script works by:

- **Removing popup elements** (like the "Upgrade to Plus" banner).
- **Clearing blur styles** (using `backdrop-filter` and `filter`) from elements that obscure important controls or visual areas.
- **Watching for new blur elements** using MutationObservers, ensuring that any dynamically-loaded content also gets cleaned.
